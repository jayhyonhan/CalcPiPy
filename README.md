# CalcPiPy
Calculating the nth digit of pi using two methods.

First method: The code has a long string of pi that is hard-coded into the code. When the integer n is given, it prints the nth character of the string. It is very efficient as it requires basically no computing power, but it can "only" support up to 1 million digits.

Second method: MATHS (For nerds: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chudnovsky_algorithm)
